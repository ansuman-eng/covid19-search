# covid19-search

Booking slots for vaccines on the CoWIN website during the peak of COVID-19 2nd wave was a painful affair. 
There were no push/alert mechanisms. One had to manually check the website continuously, or else would miss slots.

I wrote a script in Python built to regularly check the CoWIN website & added an email-notif mechanism based on district/age-groups.

Around 2000 people signed up & used this to get timely vaccines for themselves & their families.
The project I'm most proud of.
